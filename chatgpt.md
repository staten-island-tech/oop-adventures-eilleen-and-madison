"How can I make a feature where the player has a chance to deal double damage?"

Step-by-Step Plan:
Import the random Module: Use random to generate a random number.
Define a Probability Threshold: Decide the chance (e.g., 20%) for double damage.
Check the Probability: Use a conditional statement to determine whether the player deals double damage.
Apply Damage Logic: If the random condition is met, double the damage; otherwise, deal normal damage.

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, damage):
        self.name = name
        self.base_damage = damage

    def attack(self):
        # Set a 20% chance for double damage
        chance = random.random()  # Generates a number between 0 and 1
        if chance <= 0.2:  # 20% chance
            print(f"Critical hit! {self.name} deals double damage!")
            return self.base_damage * 2
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} attacks normally.")
            return self.base_damage

# Example Usage
player = Player("Hero", 10)

# Simulating an attack
damage = player.attack()
print(f"Damage dealt: {damage}")
```

How It Works:
The random.random() function generates a number between 0 and 1.
If the random number falls below the specified threshold (in this case, 0.2), the player deals double damage.
Otherwise, normal damage is returned.
This logic can easily be adapted into your fighting game. For example, you can call the attack method after the player answers a math question correctly, and the result will determine the damage dealt.
